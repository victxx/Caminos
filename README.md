# Caminos: IRL<>Onchain

## Introduction
Caminos revolutionizes the pilgrim experience on the Camino de Santiago by integrating digital innovation into a centuries-old tradition. By leveraging blockchain technology, Caminos helps users create, collect, and curate unique digital stamps throughout their journey. Using the Zora SDK, each digital stamp collected is minted as an NFT, ensuring that each moment is authenticated and permanently recorded on the blockchain.

## Key Features
- **Digital Stamps Collection**: Pilgrims can collect digital stamps via QR codes and geolocation verification.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ensures authenticity and permanence of collected stamps through NFT minting.
- **Secure Wallet Integration**: Utilizes Coinbase Smart Wallet for secure wallet management and transaction handling.
- **Versatile Use Cases**: Beyond the Camino, adaptable for treasure hunts, cultural tours, gamified events, and more.

## How It Fits into Creator Track
Caminos aligns perfectly with the goals of the Creator Track by enabling users to create, collect, and curate digital mints. This project embodies Zoraâ€™s mission to make creating on the internet free and valuable, supporting and valuing user creativity through a secure and innovative platform.

## How It Fits into Coinbase Smart Wallet
Caminos integrates the Coinbase Smart Wallet to provide a secure and seamless experience for managing digital stamps. This integration ensures that each collected stamp is securely stored on the blockchain, offering a trusted and reliable method for handling transactions.

## How It Fits into OnchainKit
By utilizing OnchainKit, Caminos ensures efficient and secure management of blockchain interactions, from QR code scanning and geolocation verification to NFT minting. This integration supports the project's goal of providing a modern, secure, and memorable way to document pilgrimages and various other experiences.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: Framework for building the web application.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing and improved code quality.
- **React**: Library for building user interfaces.
- **Zora SDK**: For minting NFTs.
- **Coinbase Wallet SDK**: For secure wallet integration.
- **Web3.js**: For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **QR Code Scanner**: For reading QR codes.
- **Geolocation API**: For verifying user location.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caminos.git
    cd caminos
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Run the development server**:
    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```

## Deployment
The project is deployed on Vercel. You can deploy your own version by connecting the repository to Vercel and following the deployment instructions.

## Challenges I Ran Into
One of the significant challenges was integrating the QR code scanning and geolocation features with blockchain transactions in a user-friendly manner. Ensuring the security and authenticity of each digital stamp required careful handling of asynchronous operations and error management. Compatibility issues with different libraries and frameworks were also encountered and resolved through rigorous testing and detailed documentation.

Moreover, as a graphic designer and not a developer, this being my first solo hackathon, integrating all components by myself was a substantial challenge. The final version on Vercel provides a clear idea of the intended functionality and the tools integrated. This experience has been enriching, fueling my desire to continue learning about Web3 and blockchain technology.
